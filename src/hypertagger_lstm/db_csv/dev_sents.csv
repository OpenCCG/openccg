1345|the S&amp;P index start.01 slide.01 in price in September_1976 and fall.01 12_% in 1977 &#45;&#45; despite a 15_% expansion in dividend that year
1346|that pattern PERF n&apos;t always hold.03 but recent strong growth in dividend make.02 some market watcher anxious
1347|payout on the S&amp;P 500 stock rise.01 10_% in 1988 accord to Standard &amp; Poor Corp. and Wall Street estimate for 1989 growth be generally between 9_% and 14_%
1348|many people believe.01 the growth in dividend will slow.02 next year although a minority see.01 double&#45;digit gain continue.01
1349|meanwhile many market watcher say.01 recent dividend trend raise.01 another warning flag &#58; while dividend PERF rise.01 smartly their expansion PERF n&apos;t keep.03 pace with even stronger advance in stock price
1350|as a result the market dividend yield dividend as a percentage of price PERF slide.02 to a level be fairly low and unenticing by historical standard
1351|put.02 another way the decline in the yield suggest.01 stock PERF get.03 pretty rich in price relative to the dividend they pay.01 some market analyst say.01
1352|they PROG keep.XX a close watch on the yield on the s&amp;p_500
1353|the figure be currently about 3.3 % up from 3.2_% before the recent market slide
1354|some analyst say.01 investor should run.02 for the exit if a sustain.01 market rebound push.01 the yield below 3_%
1355|a drop below that 3_% benchmark PERF always be a strong warning sign stock PASS fully value.01 say.01 Mr._Boesel of T._Rowe_Price
1356|in fact quote&#45;rel the market PERF always tank.01
1357|always
1358|there be never be an exception say.01 Gerald_W._Perritt a Chicago investment adviser and money manager base.02 on a review of six decade of stock&#45;market data
1359|the last time the S&amp;P 500 yield drop.01 below 3_% be in the summer of 1987
1360|stockholder take.01 the hint and sell.01 share escape.01 the October debacle
1361|there PERF be only seven other time in 1929  1933  1961  1965  1968  1971 and 1972 when the yield on the s&amp;p_500 drop.01 below 3_% for at least two consecutive month Mr._Perritt find.01
1362|and in each case he say.01 a sharp drop in stock price begin.01 within a year
1363|still some market analyst say.01 the current 3.3_% reading be n&apos;t as troublesome as it might PERF be in year past
1364|quote&#45;rel it be not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporation PROG not behave.01 in a traditional manner say.01 James_H._Coxon head of stock investment for Cigna_Corp. the Philadelphia&#45;based insurer
1365|in particular Mr._Coxon say.01 business PROG pay.03 out a smaller percentage of their profit and cash flow in the form of dividend than they have historically
1366|so while stock price may look.02 fairly high relative to dividend they be not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength
1367|rather than increase.01 dividend some company PERF use.01 cash buy.01 back some of their share note.XX Steven_G._Einhorn co&#45;chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman  Sachs &amp; Co
1368|he factor.01 that into the market yield get.01 an adjust.01 yield of about 3.6 %
1369|that be just a tad below the average of the past 40 year or so he say.01
1370|what will happen.01 to dividend growth next year
1371|common wisdom suggest.01 a single&#45;digit rate of growth reflect.01 a weakening in the economy and corporate profit
1372|PaineWebber_Inc. for instance PROG forecast.01 growth in S&amp;P 500 dividend of just under 5 % in 1990 down from an estimate.01 11_% this year
1373|in other year in there PERF be moderate economic slowdown &#45;&#45; the environment the firm expect.01 in 1990 the change in dividend range.01 from a gain of 4_% to a decline of 1_% accord to PaineWebber analyst Thomas_Doerflinger
1374|the minority argument meanwhile be business have.03 the financial wherewithal this time around declare.02 sharply higher dividend even if their earnings weaken.01
1375|dividend growth on the order of 12_% PASS expect.01 by both Mr._Coxon of Cigna and Mr._Einhorn of Goldman_Sachs
1376|those dividend bull argue.01 corporation be in the unusual position of have.03 plenty of cash leave.02 over after pay.01 dividend and make.01 capital expenditure
1377|one indicator investor might want.01 watch.01 be the monthly tally from Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s of the number of public company adjust.01 their dividend

1379|that follow.01 four straight month in the number of increase trail.01 the year&#45;earlier pace
1380|while the S&amp;P tally do n&apos;t measure.01 the magnitude of dividend change a further slippage in the number of dividend increase could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year
1381|in any case opinion be mix.01 on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get.01 even if dividend growth continue.01 at double&#45;digit level
1382|Mr._Einhorn of Goldman_Sachs estimate.01 the stock market will deliver.01 a 12_% to 15_% total return from appreciation and dividend over the next 12 month &#45;&#45; vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps 7_% or 8_% if dividend growth be weak
1383|but Mr._Boesel of T._Rowe_Price also expect.01 12_% growth in dividend next year do n&apos;t think.01 it will help.01 the overall market all that much
