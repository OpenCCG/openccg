38542|of course Mr._Mason do not use.01 neutral language
38543|as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old day on the Borscht_Belt live television and the nightclub circuit Mr._Mason instinctively reach.03 for the vernacular

38550|the latter typically be the humor of the underdog and it PASS perfect.01 by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mock.01 their white and gentile audience along with themselves
38551|in the hand of a zealot like Lenny_Bruce this double&#45;edged blade could cut.01 both the self and the audience to ribbon
38552|but wield.01 by a pro like Jackie_Mason it be a constructive form of mischief
38553|why constructive
38554|because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mix.01 they be similar in one respect &#58; both can serve.01 as mechanism for ease.02 tension and facilitate.01 the co&#45;existence of group in conflict
38555|as Elizabeth_Kristol write.01 in the New_York_Times just before the Mason donnybrook quote&#45;rel perhaps intolerance would not boil.02 over with such intensity if honest difference PASS allow.01 simmer.01

38566|and it PERF remain.01 there as evidence.01 by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom call.01 quote&#45;rel Bridget love Bernie whose sole distinction be it lead.03 to the real&#45;life marriage of Meredith_Baxter and David_Birney
38567|clearly the question with quote&#45;rel Chicken_Soup be not whether the pot will boil.02 over but whether it will simmer.01 at all
38568|so far the bubble PERF be few and far between
38569|part of the problem be the tendency of all sitcom ever since the didactic day of Norman_Lear preach.01 about social issue
38570|to some extent this tendency emerge.01 whenever the show try.01 enlighten.01 us about ethnic stereotype by reverse.01 them
38571|for instance Michael dislike.01 Jackie not because he be a shrewd Jewish businessman but because he quit.01 his well&#45;paying job as a salesman in order become.01 a social worker
38572|even more problematic be the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr._Mason comic persona
38573|but too often these routine lack.01 spark because this sitcom like all sitcom be timid about confront.01 Mr._Mason stock in trade &#45; ethnic difference
38574|I PROG not suggest.01 that the producer start.01 put.03 together episode about topic like the Catholic&#45;Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz

39890|regard the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep._Tom_Lantos chairman of the House_Subcommittee on Employment and Housing allege.01
39891|1 that your Sept. 28 editorial kangaroo committee be factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading
39892|I think.01 your editorial be factually accurate and deliberately elucidative
39893|2 that Mr._Lantos support.01 the rights of the witness take.01 the Fifth_Amendment
39894|yes he do
39895|as I watch.01 him on C&#45;Span I hear.01 him speak.01 those lovely word about the Bill of Rights he quote.01 from the transcript of the hearing
39896|he do repeat.01 those nice platitude several time as an indication of his support for the Constitution
39897|he use.01 about 56 word defend.01 the witness constitutional rights
39898|Unfortunately by my rough guess he use.01 better than 5000 word heap.01 scorn on the witness for exercise.01 the Fifth
39899|he sandwich.01 his praise of constitutional meat between large loaf of bilious commentary
39900|as your editorial rightly point.02 out Samuel_Pierce former HUD secretary and Lance_Wilson Mr._Pierce former aide PROG currently PASS hold.02 up to scorn for take.01 the Fifth_Amendment
39901|that certainly be not the supposed quote&#45;rel distorted reading indicate.01 by Mr._Lantos
39902|3 that his committee do not deal.01 with any possible criminal activity at HUD
39903|quote&#45;rel my colleague and I fully realize.01 we be not a court etc
39904|absolute rubbish
39905|apparently their verdict be in
39906|right now they PROG pursue.01 evidence
39907|that be not a bad way proceed.01 just somewhat different from standard American practice
39908|how PASS that practice refer.01 to when I be in school
39909|yes something call.01 a Star_Chamber
39910|of course Mr._Lantos doth protest his subcommittee simply seek.01 information for legislative change
39911|no doubt that be partially true
39912|everything Mr._Lantos say.01 in his letter be partially true
39913|he be right about his subcommittee responsibility when it come.12 to obtain.01 information from prior HUD official
39914|but if his explanation of motivation be true why PASS his investigation so orient.01 as identify.01 criminal activity
39915|why not simply question design.01 identify.01 source and cause of waste and inefficiency
39916|such as happen.01 when Congress want.01 know.01 about $_400 toilet seat or whatever they supposedly cost.01
39917|no Mr._Lantos complaint simply wo n&apos;t wash.02
39918|4 that the Journal defend.01 quote&#45;rel the sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence&#45;peddling and abuse of the public take.14 place while Mr._Pierce be secretary of HUD etc. and so forth
39919|no to my mind the Journal do not defend.01 sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence&#45;peddling and abuse of the public trust ...
39920|it defend.01 appropriate constitutional safeguard and practical common sense
39921|the problem the Journal so rightly point.02 out in a number of article be not the likes of Mr._Lantos after all be really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by Congress enhance.01 itself into a quasi&#45;parliamentary\/judicial body
39922|&#45;lrb&#45; of course we PERF also get.02 a judiciary seek.01 the same objective
39923|the system be the problem not an individual member
39924|individual can always have.04 their hand slap.01
39925|it be when such slapping do n&apos;t occur.01 we PERF get.02 trouble
39926|I do not by any means defend.01 HUD management
39927|the last time I see.01 a similar congressional hearing be when Tail_Gunner_Joe_McCarthy do.02 his work

39930|I disagree.01 with the statement by Mr._Lantos that one should not draw.02 an adverse inference against former HUD official assert.03 their Fifth Amendment privilege against self&#45;incrimination in congressional hearing
39931|the Fifth_Amendment state.01 in relevant part no person shall PASS compel.01 in any criminal case be a witness against himself
39932|this privilege against self&#45;incrimination preclude.01 the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant choose.01 not testify.01
39933|thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment.01 on a defendant failure testify.01 nor can the defendant PASS compel.01 take.01 the stand as a witness thus force.01 him take.01 the Fifth
39934|the privilege however PERF PASS limit.01 in accordance with its plain language protect.01 the defendant in criminal matter only
39935|the Supreme_Court and some state PERF specifically recognize.02 quote&#45;rel the Fifth_Amendment do not preclude.01 the inference where the privilege PASS claim.01 by a party to a civil cause
39936|Baxter v. Palmingiano 425_u.s._308 &#45;lrb&#45; 1976
39937|thus in a civil case a defendant may PASS call.02 as a witness  he may PASS force.01 testify.01 or take.01 the Fifth and his taking of the Fifth may permit.01 the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter
39938|absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order.01 the defendant testify.01
39939|thus when Mr._Pierce assert.03 the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding particularly after presumably receive.01 extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude.01 he hold.01 a good&#45;faith  justifiable belief his testimony could PASS use.01 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
39940|the subcommittee Congress and the American public have.03 every right draw.02 the adverse inference and concur.01 with Mr._Pierce own belief his testimony could help.01 convict.01 him of a crime
39941|draw.02 the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing do not offend.01 the Fifth Amendment shield against self&#45;incrimination
