the lower result Mr._Pierce say.01 reflect.01 a 12&#45;month decline in industry sale of privately own.01 pay telephone Elcotel primary business
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24]
although Mr._Pierce expect.01 that line of business strengthen.01 in the next year he say.01 Elcotel will also benefit.01 from move.01 into other area
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32]
within the next year Elcotel expect.01 place.01 10000 fax machine make.01 by Minolta in Japan in hotel  municipal building  drugstore and other public setting around the country
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16]
Elcotel will provide.01 a credit&#45;card reader for the machine collect.01  store.01 and forward.01 billing datum
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17]
Mr._Pierce say.01 Elcotel should realize.02 a minimum of $_10 of recur.01 net earnings for each machine each month
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26]
Elcotel PERF also develop.02 an automatic call processor will make.04 further use of the company system for automate.01 and handle.01 credit&#45;card call and collect call
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w14, w15, w16, w17, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32]
the company will also PROG produce.01 a new line of convenience telephone do n&apos;t accept.01 coin for use in hotel lobby  office lobby  hospitality lounge and similar setting
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20]
Mr._Pierce estimate.01 the processor and convenience phone would produce.01 about $_5 of recur.01 net earnings for each machine each month
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13]
of all the ethnic tension in America which be the most troublesome right now
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12]
a good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New_York_City
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25]
or so it must seem.01 to Jackie_Mason the veteran Jewish comedian appear.01 in a new ABC sitcom air on Tuesday night &#45;lrb&#45; 9 p.m. EDT
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35]
not only be Mr._Mason the star of quote&#45;rel Chicken_Soup he be also the inheritor of a comedic tradition date.01 back to quote&#45;rel Duck_Soup and he be currently a man in hot water
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15]
Mr._Mason say.01 many Jewish voter feel.01 guilty toward black so they support.01 black candidate uncritically
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w16, w17, w18, w19]
he say.01 many black voter feel.01 bitter about racial discrimination so they too support.01 black candidate uncritically
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15]
he say.01 Jews PERF contribute.01 more to black cause over the year than vice versa
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8]
of course Mr._Mason do not use.01 neutral language
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26]
as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old day on the Borscht_Belt live television and the nightclub circuit Mr._Mason instinctively reach.03 for the vernacular
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w13, w15, w16, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24]
he say.01 Jews be sick with complex and he call.01 David_Dinkins Mr._Giuliani black opponent quote&#45;rel a fancy shvartze with a mustache
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26]
if Mr._Mason PERF use.01 less derogatory language articulate.01 his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New_Yorkers would the water be quite so hot
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w15, w16, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w29, w30, w31, w32]
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by Mr._Mason remark PERF bother.02 distinguish.01 between the substance of his comment and the fact he use.01 insulting language
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21]
in addition some of Mr._Mason critic PERF imply.01 his type of ethnic humor be itself a form of racism
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18]
for example the New York state counsel for the NAACP say.01 Mr._Mason be quote&#45;rel like a dinosaur
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10]
quote&#45;rel people PROG fast leave.01 the place where he PASS stick.01
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35, w36, w37]
the latter typically be the humor of the underdog and it PASS perfect.01 by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mock.01 their white and gentile audience along with themselves
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21]
in the hand of a zealot like Lenny_Bruce this double&#45;edged blade could cut.01 both the self and the audience to ribbon
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14]
but wield.01 by a pro like Jackie_Mason it be a constructive form of mischief
[w0, w1]
why constructive
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35]
because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mix.01 they be similar in one respect &#58; both can serve.01 as mechanism for ease.02 tension and facilitate.01 the co&#45;existence of group in conflict
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w28]
as Elizabeth_Kristol write.01 in the New_York_Times just before the Mason donnybrook quote&#45;rel perhaps intolerance would not boil.02 over with such intensity if honest difference PASS allow.01 simmer.01
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w15, w16, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34]
the question be if group conflict still exist.01 as undeniably they do and if Mr._Mason type of ethnic humor be passe then what other means do we have.03 for let.01 off steam
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w11, w12, w13, w16, w17, w18, w19, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33]
do n&apos;t say.01 the TV sitcom because that happen.02 be a genre in its desperate need attract.01 everybody and offend.01 nobody resemble.01 politics more than it do comedy
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29]
it be true the best sitcom do allow.01 group difference simmer.01 &#58; yuppie vs. blue&#45;collar Bostonians in quote&#45;rel Cheers ; child vs. adult in quote&#45;rel the Cosby_Show
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8]
but these be not the difference make.01 headline
[w0, w1, w2, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35, w36, w37, w38]
in quote&#45;rel Chicken_Soup Mr._Mason play.02 Jackie a Jewish bachelor court.01 Maddie &#45;lrb&#45; Lynn_Redgrave an Irish widow and mother of three against the wish of his mother &#45;lrb&#45; Rita_Karin and her brother Michael &#45;lrb&#45; Brandon_Maggart
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9]
it be worth note.XX both disapproving relative be immigrant
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14]
at least they both speak.01 with strong accent as do Jackie and Maddie
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16]
it could n&apos;t be more obvious quote&#45;rel Chicken_Soup PROG PASS make.01 from an old recipe
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22]
and a safe one &#45;&#45; imagine.01 if the romance in question be between an Orthodox_Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w33, w34, w36, w38, w39, w40, w41, w42, w43, w44, w46, w47, w48, w49, w50, w51, w52]
back in the 1920 the play and movie version of quote&#45;rel Abie Irish_Rose make.02 the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrant so popular its author Anne_Nichols lose.03 a plagiarism suit on the grounds the plot PERF enter.01 the public domain
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w23, w24, w25, w26, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35, w36, w37]
and it PERF remain.01 there as evidence.01 by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom call.01 quote&#45;rel Bridget love Bernie whose sole distinction be it lead.03 to the real&#45;life marriage of Meredith_Baxter and David_Birney
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23]
clearly the question with quote&#45;rel Chicken_Soup be not whether the pot will boil.02 over but whether it will simmer.01 at all
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10]
so far the bubble PERF be few and far between
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w20, w21, w22, w23]
part of the problem be the tendency of all sitcom ever since the didactic day of Norman_Lear preach.01 about social issue
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19]
to some extent this tendency emerge.01 whenever the show try.01 enlighten.01 us about ethnic stereotype by reverse.01 them
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w28, w29, w30, w31]
for instance Michael dislike.01 Jackie not because he be a shrewd Jewish businessman but because he quit.01 his well&#45;paying job as a salesman in order become.01 a social worker
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13]
even more problematic be the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr._Mason comic persona
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27]
but too often these routine lack.01 spark because this sitcom like all sitcom be timid about confront.01 Mr._Mason stock in trade &#45; ethnic difference
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22]
I PROG not suggest.01 that the producer start.01 put.03 together episode about topic like the Catholic&#45;Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30]
but I PROG suggest.01 that they stop.01 require.01 Mr._Mason interrupt.01 his classic shtik with some line about care.01 for other people would sound.01 shmaltzy on the lip of Miss_America
[w0, w1, w2, w5, w6, w8, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19]
at your age you ought know.01 you ca n&apos;t make.01 soup without turn.01 up the flame

add.03 to unsteadiness in the industry seasonal retail ad spending pattern in newspaper PERF PASS upset.02 by shift in ownership and general hardship within the retail industry

many papers throughout the country PASS also face.01 with a slowdown in classified&#45;ad spending a booming category for newspaper in recent year
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w23, w24, w25, w26]
until recently industry analyst believe.01 decrease in retail ad spending PERF bottom.01 out and would in fact increase.01 in this year third and fourth quarter
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16]
all bet be off analyst say.01 because of the shifting ownership of the retail chain
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w26, w27, w29, w30, w31, w32]
improved paper price will help.01 offset.01 weakness in linage but the retailer problem PERF affect.01 the amount of ad linage they usually run.01 say.01 Edward_J._Atorino industry analyst for Salomon_Brothers_Inc

[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12]
2 that Mr._Lantos support.01 the rights of the witness take.01 the Fifth_Amendment
[w0, w2, w3]
yes he do
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28]
as I watch.01 him on C&#45;Span I hear.01 him speak.01 those lovely word about the Bill of Rights he quote.01 from the transcript of the hearing
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16]
he do repeat.01 those nice platitude several time as an indication of his support for the Constitution
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10]
he use.01 about 56 word defend.01 the witness constitutional rights
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21]
Unfortunately by my rough guess he use.01 better than 5000 word heap.01 scorn on the witness for exercise.01 the Fifth
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12]
he sandwich.01 his praise of constitutional meat between large loaf of bilious commentary
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w9, w10, w11, w13, w14, w16, w18, w19, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31]
as your editorial rightly point.02 out Samuel_Pierce former HUD secretary and Lance_Wilson Mr._Pierce former aide PROG currently PASS hold.02 up to scorn for take.01 the Fifth_Amendment
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w10, w11, w12]
that certainly be not the supposed quote&#45;rel distorted reading indicate.01 by Mr._Lantos
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13]
3 that his committee do not deal.01 with any possible criminal activity at HUD
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12]
quote&#45;rel my colleague and I fully realize.01 we be not a court etc
[w0, w1]
absolute rubbish
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5]
apparently their verdict be in
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5]
right now they PROG pursue.01 evidence
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15]
that be not a bad way proceed.01 just somewhat different from standard American practice
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10]
how PASS that practice refer.01 to when I be in school
[w1, w3, w4, w5, w6]
yes something call.01 a Star_Chamber
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14]
of course Mr._Lantos doth protest his subcommittee simply seek.01 information for legislative change
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5]
no doubt that be partially true
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9]
everything Mr._Lantos say.01 in his letter be partially true
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17]
he be right about his subcommittee responsibility when it come.12 to obtain.01 information from prior HUD official
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w16, w17, w18]
but if his explanation of motivation be true why PASS his investigation so orient.01 as identify.01 criminal activity
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13]
why not simply question design.01 identify.01 source and cause of waste and inefficiency
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17]
such as happen.01 when Congress want.01 know.01 about $_400 toilet seat or whatever they supposedly cost.01
[w0, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8]
no Mr._Lantos complaint simply wo n&apos;t wash.02
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w31, w32, w33, w34]
4 that the Journal defend.01 quote&#45;rel the sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence&#45;peddling and abuse of the public take.14 place while Mr._Pierce be secretary of HUD etc. and so forth
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26]
no to my mind the Journal do not defend.01 sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence&#45;peddling and abuse of the public trust ...
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8]
it defend.01 appropriate constitutional safeguard and practical common sense
[w0, w1, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w35, w36, w37, w38, w39, w41, w42, w43, w44, w45, w46]
the problem the Journal so rightly point.02 out in a number of article be not the likes of Mr._Lantos after all be really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by Congress enhance.01 itself into a quasi&#45;parliamentary\/judicial body
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w11, w12, w13, w14]
&#45;lrb&#45; of course we PERF also get.02 a judiciary seek.01 the same objective
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w6, w7, w8, w9]
the system be the problem not an individual member
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6]
individual can always have.04 their hand slap.01
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12]
it be when such slapping do n&apos;t occur.01 we PERF get.02 trouble
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8]
I do not by any means defend.01 HUD management
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14]
the last time I see.01 a similar congressional hearing be when Tail_Gunner_Joe_McCarthy do.02 his work

[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29]
I disagree.01 with the statement by Mr._Lantos that one should not draw.02 an adverse inference against former HUD official assert.03 their Fifth Amendment privilege against self&#45;incrimination in congressional hearing
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w13, w14, w15, w16, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23]
the Fifth_Amendment state.01 in relevant part no person shall PASS compel.01 in any criminal case be a witness against himself
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w16, w17, w19]
this privilege against self&#45;incrimination preclude.01 the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant choose.01 not testify.01
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w16, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w33, w34, w35, w37, w38, w39]
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment.01 on a defendant failure testify.01 nor can the defendant PASS compel.01 take.01 the stand as a witness thus force.01 him take.01 the Fifth
[w0, w1, w3, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21]
the privilege however PERF PASS limit.01 in accordance with its plain language protect.01 the defendant in criminal matter only
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w26, w27, w28]
the Supreme_Court and some state PERF specifically recognize.02 quote&#45;rel the Fifth_Amendment do not preclude.01 the inference where the privilege PASS claim.01 by a party to a civil cause
[w0, w1, w2, w4, w5, w6]
Baxter v. Palmingiano 425_u.s._308 &#45;lrb&#45; 1976
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w21, w22, w23, w24, w25, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33, w34, w35, w36, w37, w38, w39, w40, w41, w42, w43, w44, w45, w46]
thus in a civil case a defendant may PASS call.02 as a witness  he may PASS force.01 testify.01 or take.01 the Fifth and his taking of the Fifth may permit.01 the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w14]
absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order.01 the defendant testify.01
[w0, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17, w18, w19, w20, w22, w23, w24, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w34, w35, w36, w37, w38, w39, w40, w41, w42, w43, w44, w45]
thus when Mr._Pierce assert.03 the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding particularly after presumably receive.01 extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude.01 he hold.01 a good&#45;faith  justifiable belief his testimony could PASS use.01 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
[w0, w1, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w18, w19, w20, w22, w23, w25, w26, w27, w28, w29, w30, w31, w32, w33]
the subcommittee Congress and the American public have.03 every right draw.02 the adverse inference and concur.01 with Mr._Pierce own belief his testimony could help.01 convict.01 him of a crime
[w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11, w12, w13, w14, w15, w16, w17]
draw.02 the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing do not offend.01 the Fifth Amendment shield against self&#45;incrimination
