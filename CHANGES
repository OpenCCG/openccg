0.9.6 - ...
-----------

* Updated .gitignore, CHANGES and docs/index.html for transition to
  GitHub


0.9.5 - dependency length minimization, disjunctivizer, KenLM
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Added features for dependency ordering and dependency length
  minimization in realization.

* Added disjunctivizer package, for creating a disjunctive LF XML
  structure based on an LF graph difference.

* Added support for using a very large 5-gram memory-mapped language
  model with KenLM on linux.

* Added n-best parser output.

* Added option for in-memory perceptron training.


0.9.4 - broad coverage paraphrasing, CCGbank training
-----------------------------------------------------

* Added Hockenmaier-style generative probability model for parsing and
  realization.

* Added supertagger and use of adaptive supertagging in parsing.

* Added build files for CCGbank training, documented in
  docs/ccgbank-README, as well as ones for parsing and realizing
  novel text (thereby generating grammatical paraphrases).

* Added release targets for CCGbank data and pre-built English models.

* Added use of Stanford tokenizer, morphological analyzer and named
  entity recognizer in parsing novel text.

* Added use of ordinary hashing for lex signs, so that signs that
  differ only in the pos tag can be distinguished (for robustness).

* Added hypertagger input option and derivation history output to ccg-realize.

* Added n-best realization output to ccg-test.

* Added tracking of lex heads to signs via modifier attr on slashes.

* Added gold standard pred info for training with hypertagger.

* Added initial syntactic feature extractor.

* Added caching of supertags in cats.

* Added option to use word positions in converting atoms in the LFs, 
  which is now the default.  Added :nowordpos command in tccg to 
  change the preference to the lexical naming option.
  
* Changed tccg to also update Grammar.theGrammar.prefs, which seems 
  to have fixed issue with :nosem option not working.
  
* Refactored feature extraction to use a trie for representing features 
  as a sequence of interned string keys, to allow for lazy feature 
  extraction that more quickly filters features not in the alphabet.
  
* Added serialization of signs.

* Added python script for drawing derivs in .auto files as trees (uses NLTK).

* Added cell pruning limit in realization.
  
* Added support for 'magic tokens' (like numbers) in ccg2xml,
  contributed by vanjena@users.sourceforge.net.

* Turned off caching of category hash codes b/c of problems with stale 
  values (a method of checking for staleness might be added later).

* Improved utf8 support (esp. for macs).  Note that utf8 support seems
  hopelessly broken for the Windows command-line, in that none of the
  available terminal apps (including for cygwin) both display
  characters correctly and work with tccg.  I/O to files works fine
  though.

* Added xml escaping for bleu and nbest output.

* Added ccg-draw-graph tool for visualizing semantic dependency
  graphs.

  
0.9.3 - minor changes
-------------------

* Added runCommand method in Visualizer so that the latex
  visualization works on Linux

* Added id info to test items and bleu output.

* Changed default lex licensing feature to be last in Lexicon.loadLicensingFeatures.

* Added loop for computing closure of licensed no sem edges in EdgeFactory.

* Changed FeatureLicenser to unify feat strucs instead of cats.

 
0.9.2 - VisCCG release plus initial hypertagger support
-------------------------------------------------------
* Added check for unary rule cycles in parser and realizer.

* Added initial version of greedy fragment assembly in realization when 
  a complete realization is not found.
  
* Added case for composition of X/Y Y/Z where Y has arity 2.

* Added option to filter rule apps by observed supercat-rule combos.

* VisCCG: Please see the list of changes in the archives at http://comp.ling.utexas.edu/wiki/doku.php/openccg/dev

* Added LexSemOrigin interface for tracking of origin of lexical 
  predications back to a sign or unary type changing rule.

* Removed unused LF in DataItem.

* Added supertagger-based filtering to lexical lookup.

* Upgraded to JDOM 1.1.

* Upgraded parser to use ambiguity packing.

* Added scoring and n-best pruning to parser.

* Refactored SignScorer to synsem package, for shared use
  by the realizer and parser.  NB:  This may require minor
  refactoring of imports and recompilation of realizer clients.

* Changed realizer to check instantiation of outermost args by 
  default, thereby improving completness at minor cost to efficiency.
  Accordingly, renamed checkInstantiation flag in EdgeFactory to 
  debugInstantiation, which now controls whether to report such 
  cats to System.err.

* Added hypertagger (realizer supertagger) interface and initial 
  version of beta-best realization using it.
  
* Changed Family.deriveSupertag to remove the semantic part of a 
  cat name following a colon.


0.9.1 - New tools: grammardoc, ccg2xml; other misc updates
----------------------------------------------------------
* Changed dateFormatNoYear to "*.MM.dd" to avoid ambiguity with 
  numbers.
  
* Changed Grammar.initializeTransformers to set indenting more robustly 
  by adding try-catch blocks for illegal argument exceptions.
  
* Refactored RuleGroup to apply unary and binary rules separately.

* Refactored Lexicon and RuleGroup to load lex/morph/rule info incrementally, 
  using a new XmlScanner utility class.  These changes avoid the need to 
  store large XML docs all in memory at once, while keeping the refactoring 
  to a minimum.
  
* Revised LF flattening to propapage the alts, opts & chunks based on 
  the expression structure, rather than the graph structure.  
  This change makes the 'shared' attribute (on nominal references) 
  more transparent in how it works with disjunctions that operate on 
  different levels of the tree.

* Revised LF compaction to allow duplicate predications, where an attempt 
  is made to attach them in different locations if possible.

* Added GrammarDoc, which generates HTML documentation from a source grammar.
  See README, under `Generating Grammar Documentation' for more information.

* Added initial version of ccg2xml, for specifying grammars in the 
  more human-friendly .ccg format.
  
* Changed build system
  - Made separate build files for ccg2xml and documentation
  - Made the `release' target of the main build file create a binary for
    distribution, instead of just the source
  
  
0.9.0 - Disjunctive LFs
-----------------------
* Refactored realizer to put all no-sem edges on the agenda, 
  which requires making an exception for edges with no indices 
  in the implementation of the index filter, but otherwise 
  yields a more uniform approach to creating edges.
  
* Refactored realizer to use representative edges (one per cat) 
  instead of edge groups, which ends up being simpler on the whole 
  and should be easier to explain.
  
* Refactored categories to allow for equality checks with and 
  without taking the LFs into consideration.
  
* Refactored edge equiv classes to use coverage bit vector 
  and cat sans LF to check equality.
  
* Refactored lex instantiation to produce all possible instantiations 
  that respect the alt exclusivity constraints.
  
* Changed Sign, DerivationHistory to store rule object.

* Changed alt edge construction to create new LF from input signs and rule, 
  since signs in equiv class of alts can now have different LFs.
  
* Added active alt tracking and completing of edges with optional bits.

* Changed HyloVar to check for equal types when checking for equality up 
  to var renaming.
  
* Refactored generics to avoid type warnings in Eclipse.

* Relaxed LF chunking constraints to allow combinations with edges 
  (or trackers more generally) that are shared across multiple 
  alt set options.
  
* Added "shared" attribute to nominal terms to indicate references 
  to nodes that are shared across alternatives in a disjunctive LF; 
  then revamped and reinforced the LF chunking constraints.
  
* Fixed problem with signMap not pointing to opt-completed edge.

* Improved edge printing from realizer chart to show derivations.

* Updated realizer to keep edges whose signs have the simplest derivation, 
  among those with the same surface words.
  
* Added filter for ungrammatical test cases in ccg-test text output.

* Added first draft of realizer manual.

  
0.8.6 - Java 1.5 switch, n-gram scoring improvements
----------------------------------------------------
* Added propagation of reverse flag on n-gram models.

* Refactored LinearNgramScorerCombo and n-gram models to 
  support interpolation at the word level.

* Added caching of log probs in NgramScorer, to avoid recomputing 
  log prob of words for a sign's initial sign.

* Added n-gram diversity pruning strategy.

* Changed SignHash to only keep signs that are unique up to surface words, 
  thereby ignoring different POS or supertags; also changed it to keep 
  signs with lower derivational complexity during insertion.
  
* Added reverse flag for loaded n-gram models with ccg-test, ccg-realize.

* Fixed sentence delimiter text output for reversible standard n-gram models; 
  made AAnFilter reversible.
  
* Added Xalan 2.6.0 jars, to support Java 1.5 builds.

* Added support for duration special tokens; note that the implementation has 
  an unavoidable dependency on Java 1.5.
 
 
0.8.5 - "Rough Guide", sem types, command history/completion, and more
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
* Added initial core-en/types.xml.

* Generalized feature licensing to allow for selective listing of supertypes 
  in the also-licensed-by attribute.
  
* Fixed bug in unifying two vars with simple types.

* Removed useless SignHash.values method; clarified intention to 
  eventually remove this class.
  
* Streamlined lexical access for realization.

* Removed superfluous unique stamps in var classes.

* Added support for using simple types (aka sorts) with semantic features 
  and nominals.  During category instantiation, a morph item's class is 
  assigned to the nominal var(s) for the [*DEFAULT*] proposition, and
  the types of all nominal vars are then propagated to all other 
  nominal vars with the same name, throughout the category.  
  
* Changed tokenizer keep-words-with-sem-classes option in grammar.xsd 
  to replacement-sem-classes option, where all semantic classes to use 
  in replacing words with sem classes for language models are listed. 
  Also changed semantic class replacement routine to uppercase semantic 
  class names.
  
* Added initial sem types to core-en, comic, and flights grammars.

* Fixed bug in constructing type hierarchies with multiple inheritance.

* Added ccg-update tool, with initial task to add full words (pre-parsed) 
  to the testbed file; also updated ccg-test to use the pre-parsed words 
  when writing training text files.
  
* Updated ccg-cvr tool to use full words when present.
  Also added filter to remove test item duplicates from 
  cross-validation training sets.

* Added reporting of mean reciprocal rank to ccg-test, as well 
  as residual mean reciprocal rank, based on the cases that do 
  not match the target exactly.

* Updated ccg-cvr tool to work with factored language models.

* Fixed null pointer exception in DefaultTokenizer.format, Word.setW methods.

* Added timing of lex lookup to realization metrics.

* Added David's JLine console support to tccg, with command completion and 
  per grammar history.

* Added handling of coarticulations in the lexicon.

* Added caching of lex lookup during realization.

* Updated to-apml.xsl to handle 'and' in multiword elements.

* Updated visualizer to handle word lists and to ignore coarts.

* Added repetition scorer, for discounting repetitive realizations.

* Added scorer class, pruning strategy class options to ccg-realize.

* Added workaround for saving command history correctly with Java 1.4 on Linux.
 
* Added 'tiny' grammar.

* Added grammars "rough guide".

* Added supertag as another word attr.

* Revamped LMs to use trie maps, for better speed & scalability.

* Improved handling of nulls in FLMs.

* Cleaned up word representations.

* Added even/odd selection for scoring too in ccg-test.

* Added -reverse and -scorer options to ccg-test.

* Added reverse LM capability.

* Made supertag attrs configurable.

* Switched to JDOM 1.0.


0.8.4 - Factored language models (initial support), packing/unpacking, and more
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
* Added Alex's latex visualization of derivations
  (nb: launch of previewer works better on Windows than Linux)

* Added customizable tokenization and expansion routines for 
  dates/times/nums/amounts and other named entities.
  
* Added -2apml option to ccg-test.

* Added Word class and many related changes to tokenization.

* Added -textf|-textfsc options to ccg-test, for writing files in the format 
  expected by the SRILM toolkit for factored language models.

* Updated copyright notices.

* Changed ngram model to use canonical lists of words as keys, 
  removing size restriction. 
  
* Added -aanfilter option to ccg-test, with an optional list of
  exceptions, which may be culled from bigram counts.

* Added keep-words-with-sem-classes option to grammar.xsd, to 
  specify exceptional semantic classes where the word form is also 
  considered relevant for scoring models.
  
  NB: Also changed grammar.xsd to specify a custom tokenizer class name 
      and/or keep-words-with-sem-classes on a separate 
      tokenizer element.

* Added support for factored language models with fixed backoff paths,
  arranged into families of models for different child variables,
  and with the option to have secondary models for shorter available
  histories.  Also added corresponding -flm|-flmsc options to
  ccg-test.

* Added option to do scoring in a second stage, starting from a packed
  representation.
  
* Switch from cached combos to collected combos, making the anytime case
  more like the packed case.
  
* Added compacting of gen forest when unpacking is turned off.

* Added pretty-printing of regex-like gen forest.


0.8.3 - New efficiency methods, Cem-* grammars, and more
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
* Added grammars from Bozsahin and Steedman (2003).

* Improved instantiation of unary rules, ensuring that the 
  first pred is used for indexing, and fixing a bug whereby 
  a rule indexed by a lex pred would be missed.
  
* Added initial capability to use semantic classes in n-gram scoring, 
  as shown in ccg-realize.
  
* Added LF chunking rules, which yields the most dramatic improvement in
  efficiency. 

* Added systematic feature-based licensing and instantiation.

* Added caching of category combinations.

* Added labeling of the phrase in the XML output headed by the index
  associated with the <mark>+ semantic feature.
  
* Added feature filtering and LF indenting to tccg display options.

* Added XML configuration of LF relation sorting.

* Added :2tb (to testbed) command for adding the current parse to the 
  testbed.
  
* Fixed grammar loading so it no longer has to be from the current directory.

* Made it possible to list a stem as a member of an open class family with a
  separate pred, without getting an entry with the default pred too.

* Enabled indexRel to be declared at the level of entries or families.

* Added prefs import/export to tccg.

* Added ccg-cvr tool for cross-validating realizer.

* Reconfigured ccg-test with various new switches. 

* Put feature licensing on a switch.

* Made pruning strategy configurable.

* Changed representation of coord to work better with 
  chunking (though less concise).

* Added option to stop realizer after new best time limit (past first 
  complete realization) is exceeded, via :nbtl N command


0.8.2 - Edge pruning during realization, XML/APML I/O, and more
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
* Changed build to ccg-build, in bin directory; 
  also added separate build.xml files to each sample 
  grammar directory.  This way, a call to ccg-build 
  either builds the system or the current grammar, 
  depending on what directory you're in.
  
* Changed realizer to no longer allow unmatched 
  attr preds (ie sem features).  This way, the presence 
  of certain sem features can be used to control realization 
  choices, instead of requiring these features to always 
  be present.  To underspecify these choices, the idea 
  is to eventually allow for their optional inclusion. 

* Added more options to turn settings off individually in tccg.

* Enabled realizer to handle type changing rules with 
  their own semantics in the result category.
  
* Added configurable edge pruning per category during 
  realization, which controls the number of edges with 
  equivalent categories to keep in the chart.
  
* Fixed unification bug by adding occurs checks to Dollar's fill 
  method, needed at least in part b/c ArgStack doesn't quite 
  implement Unifiable.
  
* Replaced hashString with hashCode and equals up to var names, 
  yielding a 4-5% improvement in efficiency.
  
* Switched to grammar.xml file.  If none exists, an attempt is 
  made to load from the default files lexicon.xml, morph.xml and 
  rules.xml.  See grammar.xsd for format.
  
* Added LF load/save from/to XML via a sequence of transformations 
  specified in the grammar.xml file.

* Added save-to-xml (:2xml) option for saving LFs to XML 
  files from tccg.
  
* Added save-to-apml (:2apml) option for saving last input string to 
  APML files from tccg.
  
* Updated parser to apply unary rules repeatedly.

* Various updates to flights grammar, including use of FrameNet roles.
  

0.8.1 - OpenCCG Release with XML Schemas (!)
---------------------------------------------------- 
This release adds XML Schema validation to the grammar build 
process, where the comments in the XML schemas also 
serve as reference documentation for the grammar formats (wahoo!).
The release also contains several bug fixes to the unification 
routines, and a more substantial "flights" grammar with 
semantic control over pitch accents and boundary tones.


0.8.0 - First OpenNLP CCG Library Release 
---------------------------------------------------- 
Reorganized directories and renamed packages and tools. 
Added build target for worldcup sample grammar. 
Rewrote scripts for simplicity and parallelism. 
Cut out pre-processing components and any classes and  
libraries that looked like dead wood.  Started removing 
unnecessary interfaces.


Grok 0.7.0 - Towards a CCG Realizer
---------------------------------------------------- 
Mike is taking over Grok development and repurposing it for primary 
use as a CCG Realizer in limited domain dialogue systems. 
See http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~mwhite/White-Baldridge-ENLG-2003-to-appear.pdf 
for a description of the effort so far.
Version 0.7.0 will be the last Grok release.
After this version, Grok will be split into separately usable 
and separately developed OpenNLP components.
Tom Morton will be responsible for further development of the 
pre-processing components.
Mike will be responsible for further development of the CCG 
parser and realizer.


Grok 0.6.0 - Multi-Modal CCG
---------------------------------------------------- 
For more information, see Jason's dissertation available at:
http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/~jmb/dissertation
